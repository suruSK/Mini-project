This project aims to implement a system that detects the presence of a person in a given space using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The system uses a camera to capture video feed, which is processed on a computer using OpenCV and YOLO algorithms to detect the presence of a person. The result of the object detection is then sent to an Arduino UNO microcontroller, which controls a relay module to switch on or off the lights in the space based on the presence or absence of a person. The project involves the integration of multiple hardware and software components, including a camera, computer, Arduino UNO, relay module, and OpenCV/YOLO libraries. The system was implemented and tested in a real-world scenario, and the results show that the system is capable of accurately detecting the presence of a person and controlling the lights accordingly.
The project has several potential applications in various industries, such as home automation, security, and energy management. The system can be further improved by adding additional sensors, such as temperature and humidity sensors, to enhance its functionality. We chose YOLO (You Only Look Once) as the object detection algorithm for this project for several reasons. YOLO is a popular deep learning-based algorithm that is known for its high accuracy and real-time performance. Unlike other object detection algorithms.
Keywords: Arduino UNO, light automation, YOLO, OpenCv, Object detection etc.
